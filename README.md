Lab 6 prototype plan:
    Since backend is largely functioning, the main goal is to work in seperate branches to create
    skeleton UI for website and create endpoints + database for the backend.

    Want:
        - Frontend with connected pages
        - Can connect/make get to the backend
        - Backend has a connected database
        - Backend has endpoints to connect to front end
